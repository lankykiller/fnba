Fantasy NBA game.

Learned about how to web scrape and intereact with local mySQL database.

In summary you can web scrabe from espn and extract player box scores. After that you can add the box scores to the database. From the database you can take the total points from players.

Next step should be making an interface where to select the players and then see the total points. Also to make the possibility to scrape more box scores and to add them to the database.

Used mySQL, Java with Maven.
